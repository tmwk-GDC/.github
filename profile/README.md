# Create a new repository

<!-- If you need to create a new Terraform repository for a customer or a project, follow these steps :

- Create a new repository with and select the correct template according the Cloud Provider you need : Azure or AWS. You can also open the repository template and click on Use this template

- Define its name, but follow this convention : customer-project-[sub-project/extra-string]. If it is an internal project, set customer to teamwork. The objective of the convention is to let repositories owners the choice to create multiple repositories for a project or aggregate then under a single repository : For a project, you can have an environment by repository or create all your environment under one repository. It also makes easier to seek for all project for a specific customer. Here are some valids examples :
  - teamwork-app1
  - mycustomerA-landing-zone-network
  - mycustomerB-sap-dev

- Create it and then follow the template rules that are describe in your new project README.md file : you will setup branch rules and environment variables. -->
